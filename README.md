# Second Year Team Project: Java Game
For my team project in the second year of my CS degree I build a multiplayer platform game in Java together with 5 other students.

# My Role
My role in the project was to handle the networking for the game to allow it to be multiplayer. 
I designed a server and implement a packeting system to handle player movement, player interaction with the game and also changes to the game itself. You can view the work I did under src/network and also src/game/network/packets.

# My reflection on the project which I wrote in our final report
"I worked on the multiplayer aspect of the game and built the network that all client server communications run through. A designed a system to send packets of data between the players through the server to always keep the running games in sync. The player movement and animations in single player are so smooth and clean and I’m very happy with how I’ve been able to maintain this high quality in multiplayer. Many aspects of the game have had to run through the server for them to be timed properly and although it has been a struggle at times, I am extremely pleased with how well it all works."

I received 84% for the project.
